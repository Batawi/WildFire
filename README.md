# WildFire
Simulation of wildfire spread using cellular automaton.

Simulation is based on:
* Wind direction and it's power
* Type of burning material (with it's properties)
* State of burning material
* Lay of the land (i.e. water reservoir as fire spread barier)

Wind's power and direction are constant for whole map.
Maps are random generated.
