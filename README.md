# WildFire
Simulation of wildfire spread using cellular automaton.

Simulation is based on:
* Wind direction and it's power
* Type of burning material (with it's properties)
* State of burning material
* Lay of the land (i.e. water reservoir as fire spread barier)

Wind's power and direction are constant for whole map but changes in time.
Maps are random generated.
To run it use Python3.
