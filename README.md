# WildFire
Simulation of wildfire spread using cellular automaton.

Simulation is based on:
* Wind direction and its power
* Type of burning material (with its properties)
* State of burning material
* Lay of the land (i.e. water reservoir as fire barier)

Winds power and direction are constant for whole map but changes in time.
Maps are randomly generated.
To run it use Python3.
